### Results:
* GOOD: 
    - Fairly good results.
    - Vocabulary provided is adequate for the sentence. 
    - Hints are useful to guide the user into constructing the sentence. 
        * Two of the three hints are adequate and don't disclose the answer. 
* BAD: 
    - The first hint: "_A primeira parte é uma oração condicional (algo do tipo: “Se fores à…”)._" is giving the conjugated verb away (_fores_).

* TO-DO:
    - There might be two ways of constructing this phrase. I was thinking of using an _infinitivo pessoal_ because that's what I was learning in class and according to my teacher in European Portuguese people prefer it instead of the Conditional (which is also correct). However the assistant states it's the other way around. **I suspect HALLUCINATION**.
    - The examples are too long and I don't feel happy about them. Better examples should be included, probably.
