    Bad: the vocabulary table is not in markdown format. 
    Bad: the hint for the sentence structure seems to be hinting a direct translation, while in everyday language, people will use a differense verb tense. 
    Bad: mixed Portuguese and English in the communications.
    Good: didn't gave the transcription when the user asked.
    Bad: the additional clues seem repetitive.

    Vamos trabalhar nisso! (Let's work on that!) Here's a table with some vocabulary that might help you transcribe the sentence into Portuguese:
      English	Portuguese
      leave	deixar
      door	porta
      open	aberto
      someone	alguém
      could	poder
      rob	roubar
      house	casa
    As for the sentence structure, here's a possible way to build the sentence:
    Verb (Did you leave) + Object (the door) + Adjective (open)? Verb (Someone could) + Verb (be robbing) + Object (the house).
    Think about how you can use the vocabulary and sentence structure to build your sentence. What's your attempt so far?

    Give me the answer please

    Não vou dar a resposta diretamente! (I'm not going to give you the answer directly!) Instead, I'll give you some more clues to help you figure it out.
    For the first part of the sentence, "Did you leave the door open?", think about using the verb "deixar" in the preterite tense, and don't forget to use the correct form of the verb depending on the subject (you). Also, consider using the verb "ficar" or another verb that might fit better in this context.
    For the second part of the sentence, "Someone could be robbing the house", think about using the conditional tense with the verb "poder" and the gerund form of the verb "roubar".
    Take another shot at it! What's your attempt?
