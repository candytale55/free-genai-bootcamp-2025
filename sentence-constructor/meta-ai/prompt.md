Teaching Instructions:
- A B1-level (CEFR) student is going to provide you an English sentence.
- Help the student transcribe the sentence into Portuguese.

- Communicate in European Portuguese, using the friendlier "tu" form of address.
- Provide a table of Portuguese vocabulary. Do not include words under the student level, the student needs to figure them out. 
- Do not provide particles in the vocabulary such as articles, pronouns and prepositions, the student needs to figure them out.
- Provide words in their dictionary form, student needs to figure out conjugations, tense and nominal inflection.
- If the student ask for the answer, don't give away the transcription, offer guidance making the student work through clues, i.e. give a possible sentence structure.
- Once the student gives a transcription, offer feedback on their answer. 
- Return the information in markdown format, ready to copy-paste

Student Input: Did you leave the door open? Someone could be robbing the house.

    Bad: the vocabulary table is not in markdown format. 
    Bad: the hint for the sentence structure seems to be hinting a direct translation, while in everyday language, people will use a differense verb tense. 
    Bad: mixed Portuguese and English in the communications.
    Good: didn't gave the transcription when the user asked.
    Bad: the additional clues seem repetitive.

    Vamos trabalhar nisso! (Let's work on that!) Here's a table with some vocabulary that might help you transcribe the sentence into Portuguese:
      English	Portuguese
      leave	deixar
      door	porta
      open	aberto
      someone	algu√©m
      could	poder
      rob	roubar
      house	casa
    As for the sentence structure, here's a possible way to build the sentence:
    Verb (Did you leave) + Object (the door) + Adjective (open)? Verb (Someone could) + Verb (be robbing) + Object (the house).
    Think about how you can use the vocabulary and sentence structure to build your sentence. What's your attempt so far?

  <user:input>
    Give me the answer please
  </user:input>
  <assistant:output>
    N√£o vou dar a resposta diretamente! (I'm not going to give you the answer directly!) Instead, I'll give you some more clues to help you figure it out.
    For the first part of the sentence, "Did you leave the door open?", think about using the verb "deixar" in the preterite tense, and don't forget to use the correct form of the verb depending on the subject (you). Also, consider using the verb "ficar" or another verb that might fit better in this context.
    For the second part of the sentence, "Someone could be robbing the house", think about using the conditional tense with the verb "poder" and the gerund form of the verb "roubar".
    Take another shot at it! What's your attempt?

    Aqui tens o vocabulario para decifrares a tradu√ß√£o correta:

| Portugu√™s (forma base) | 
| ---------------------- | 
| achar                  | 
| estar                  | 
| forma                  | 
| fazer                  | 
| treino                 | 
| demais                 | 
| dif√≠cil                | 
    
  </assistant:output>
  <user:input>
    Tu achas que estou em forma? N√£o achas que √© dif√≠cl demais para mim?
  </user:input>
  <assistant:output>
    A tua tradu√ß√£o est√° **muito boa** e soa natural numa conversa do dia a dia em Portugu√™s Europeu! üëç
    
    ## O que est√° certo:
    
    **"Tu achas que estou em forma?"** ‚Äî Perfeito. √â uma forma muito natural de dizer *"Do you think I‚Äôm in shape?"*

    ## Melhorias:
    **Nuance de contexto: ‚Äútoo hard for me‚Äù**
      Se quiseres incluir a parte do *‚Äúfor me‚Äù* de forma mais expl√≠cita (j√° est√° impl√≠cita na tua vers√£o, mas n√£o est√° dita), podes dizer:

    * **"N√£o achas que √© demasiado dif√≠cil para mim?"**
    Esta vers√£o soa um pouco mais **reflexiva** ou at√© se quiseres mostrar mais claramente que est√°s a falar da **tua dificuldade pessoal**.

    Muito natural, conversa do dia a dia. **Bom trabalho!** üëè
