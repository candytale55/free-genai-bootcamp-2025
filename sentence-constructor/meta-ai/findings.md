Much better result. 
The table only includes a few relevant words and no particles. 
But the table includes Spanish, so it ignored the instruction.
Clues are slightly better, but the example feels forced. 
It says it is using European Portuguese, but if this were the case, there are three possible options from the English sentence (tu, você and vocês), although the most logical would be tu or você.
The phrase seems unnatural. Possibly because the user requested an sentence with a grammar error (did you left vs did you leave)

More natural: 
(Você) Deixou a porta aberta? Alguém pode estar roubando a casa. 
(tu) Deixaste a porta aberta? Alguém pode estar a assaltar a casa.

It gave the particles away.
It gave Spanish words, along with Portuguese. 
It gave too many words. The student doesn't have to do any effort retrieving vocabulary that they should already know. 
It didn't actually give clues, this is self evident "Think about the verb conjugations and sentence structure in Portuguese. How would you phrase "Did you leave the door open?" in Portuguese? What verb tense would you use?"

Gave away the answer.
