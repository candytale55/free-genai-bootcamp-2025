- I'm testing the refined prompt from Chat-GPT in all assistants with the same sentences to be able to compare them. 



NOTES:
(2025.07.14)
This is the first assistant I tried. 
- The final prompt is not as refined.
- Therefore, the results are mediocre, but to really see if the issue is due to Meta or to the prompt, I'll have to retest the final prompt with it. 
- It would be a good idea to add better examples. 
- This is subjective, and probably because I've used it more, but I like Chat-GPT better.

Changed prompt to match Portuguese learning by a Spanish native.
Now the assistant should only give the vocabulary table in Portuguese.

The solution is too verbose. 
Also, there's a clear difference between building an assistant for Japanese phrases, than for Portuguese, especially for a Spanish native speaker. 
Added bad example as shown in the course video.

Much better result. 
The table only includes a few relevant words and no particles. 
But the table includes Spanish, so it ignored the instruction.
Clues are slightly better, but the example feels forced. 
It says it is using European Portuguese, but if this were the case, there are three possible options from the English sentence (tu, você and vocês), although the most logical would be tu or você.
The phrase seems unnatural. Possibly because the user requested an sentence with a grammar error (did you left vs did you leave)

More natural: 
(Você) Deixou a porta aberta? Alguém pode estar roubando a casa. 
(tu) Deixaste a porta aberta? Alguém pode estar a assaltar a casa.

It gave the particles away.
It gave Spanish words, along with Portuguese. 
It gave too many words. The student doesn't have to do any effort retrieving vocabulary that they should already know. 
It didn't actually give clues, this is self evident "Think about the verb conjugations and sentence structure in Portuguese. How would you phrase "Did you leave the door open?" in Portuguese? What verb tense would you use?"

Gave away the answer.
